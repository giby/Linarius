\title{
Generation of random binary genotype 
}
\description{
Generation of random binary genotype satisfying both provided ploidy levels and allele frequency. It may present an interest to cheack the validity of an observed phenomenon, doing some bootstrap for signifiance etcâ€¦ 
}
\usage{
datagen(frec, ploidy)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{frec}{
a vector giving the allele frequency of all allele, every single frequency have to be between 0 and 1}
  \item{ploidy}{
a vector giving the ploidy of every single sample, should be a non-null natural number 
}

\note{
Whenever you make something out of this function you have to precise that there are generated data. 
You shall not use this for getting fake experimental data (it constitues a violation of this package lisence ).
Whenever you use that function for bad purposes I will find you, get you and kick your ass!
