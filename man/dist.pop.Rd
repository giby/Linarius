\title{Compute genetic distances between populations}
\usage{
dist.pop(xx, pop, method = "reynolds", ploidy = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{xx}{A binary datafram of genotypes, individuals as row and alleles as column}

\item{pop}{A vector informing of population every sample belongs to}

\item{method}{A method for computing genetic distence between populations, can be any unambigous abreviation of "euclidean", "reynolds", "roger" or "nei"}

\item{ploidy}{Interger or vector, ploidy level of the population or individuals}
}
