Description: A package for phylogeographic studies. It includes functions for phylogenetics analysis which were missing from usual packages. and geographical feature which were also missing. Some functions might benefit either geneticists or geographs, some other are specific for a phylogeographic approach. Geneticist should noticed that this package is designed for dominant markers and can deal with polyploid organisms, including mixed ploidy levels. Geograph might noticed it was not concieved by an expert in geographical analysis, therefor pure geographical features are simple, but was globally missing in R.
